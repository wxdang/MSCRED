1 It is an implement of the following paper by tensorflow：
  A Deep Neural Network for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection and Diagnosis in Multivariate Time Series Data.
  
2 How to use:
  First, run the file generation_signature_matrice.py to generate signature matrice.
  Second, run the file convlstm.py to train and test the model.
  Finally, run the file evalution.py to evalute the result.
 
 3 The demo code provide by the author: https://github.com/7fantasysz/MSCRED，but bad code, hard to read.
